                <h2>Bodybuilding</h2>
                <p>Bodybuilding is the practice of progressive resistance exercise to build, control, and develop one's muscles via hypertrophy. An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder. It is primarily undertaken for aesthetic purposes over functional ones, distinguishing it from similar activities such as powerlifting and calisthenics.
                    In competitive bodybuilding, competitors appear onstage in line-ups and perform specified poses (and later individual posing routines) for a panel of judges who rank them based on conditioning, muscularity, posing, size, stage presentation, and symmetry. Bodybuilders prepare for competitions by exercising and eliminating non-essential body fat. This is enhanced at the final stage by a combination of carbohydrate loading and dehydration to achieve maximum muscle definition and vascularity. Most bodybuilders also tan and shave their bodies prior to competition..</p>

                <h2>Shredded Body</h2>
                <p>Low body fat and well-defined muscles are also referred to as a ripped or shredded body. It is attained through rigorous exercise, strict dieting, and following certain training methods. Most importantly, it takes a disciplined approach to training and nutritional intake, to get a shredded body. It is crucial that health be the top priority, and it is essential to devote the time and effort necessary to get a healthy body. Before starting any rigorous exercise or dieting regimen, it is important to discuss it with a licensed fitness expert or Registered Dietitian..</p>

                <h2>Powerlifter Body</h2>
                <p>Powerlifting is a strength sport that consists of three attempts at maximal weight on three lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift. As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting, it involves the athlete attempting a maximal weight single-lift effort of a barbell loaded with weight plates. Powerlifting evolved from a sport known as "odd lifts", which followed the same three-attempt format but used a wider variety of events, akin to strongman competition. Eventually, odd lifts became standardized to the current three..</p>
